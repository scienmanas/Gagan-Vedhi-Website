I and Arpit have always been a space enthusiast. It was around mid-January 2023, when we saw a competition on Unstop of the ongoing Shaastra, the TechFest of IIT Madras. The competition urged us to develop an innovative solution to the problem of space debris (consisting mainly of dead satellites and rocket stages).

In the present time, it is assumed that if the quantity of space debris increases as it is increasing now, it can cause launch problems to the new spacecrafts and satellites. Also, it may be dangerous for satellites orbiting in low-earth orbit. Refer to this [article](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/06/orbital-debris-space-junk-removal).

To tackle this challenge, which required innovation, we scoured the internet spending hours reading new research articles to think of an innovative solution.

After about 2-3 days of continuous googling, searching, and brainstorming, we found some newly discovered scientific facts such as the development of static charges on obsolete satellites, gecko technology, etc. By using these concepts, we came up with a new innovative idea to clear space debris by using gecko technology and static electricity.

To tackle this type of challenge, having a good team is very important. To work on this challenge, we even bunked our whole Friday class and a surprise test happened on that day. But it was surely worth it after we got the 2nd position. ðŸŽ‰
